# ELEC 221 Final Project: Climate Change

### Figures to submit

1. (5) Display frame stamped with date "April X, 2014" in grayscale, where `X = mod(40,30) + 1`
2. (5) Display frame from Figure 1 in black and white.
3. (3) Display frame from Figure 2 without the date stamp.
4. (5) Display frame from Figure 3 after applying the averaging filter.
5. (10) Plot change in ice area compared to value at beginning. Horizontal axis should by from `x = 1` to `x = 183` where *x* is days. Percentage change (y-axis) given by `(area(x) - area(1)) / area(1) * 100`
6. (4) Plot polynomial fit with data points from Figure 5.
7. (5) Plot daily ice extent for 2014 from [http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/]
8. (5) Plot % change in ice extent from Mar 21, 2014 to Sep 19, 2014 using CSV dataFIGURES.md
