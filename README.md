# ELEC 221 Final Project: Climate Change

### Project overview/purpose

To try and estimate the extent to which the antarctic ice coverage changes throughout the year using image filtering and recognition techniques, and to compare the data that we obtain from our analysis of [NASA video data]() to actual measurements done by the [NSIDC]().

### Project structure/setup instructions

The code almost works out of the box! If uncomment all of the setup lines in `src/main.m`, you should be ready to go, and all figures/tables will be automatically generated (samples in `report/figures/`) for reference.

* `report/QUESTIONS.md`: All the questions in the original assignment
* `report/ANSWERS.md`: My answers to the questions in the original assessment
* `report/FIGURES.md`: Figure descriptions/requirements

### Ideas for extensions

* Similar techniques could be applied to analysis of crop fields or city sprawl, so long as the objects being analyzed have some colours in common.
* Alter the algorithm so that the entire surface area of Antarctica is not also taken to be sea ice (for more accurate comparisons with the NSIDC data)
* Do a similar analysis over a longer period of time to quantifiably measure the effects of global warming on sea ice extent
